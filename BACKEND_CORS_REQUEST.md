# Backend Team - CORS Configuration Request

## üö® Issue
Frontend can't connect to the AI Chat API due to CORS policy blocking requests.

## üîç Error Details
```
Access to fetch at 'https://7soi1605r1.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/agentic-safety' 
from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## üìù Request for Backend Team

**Please configure CORS headers on your API endpoints to allow:**

### Development Origins:
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://localhost:3000` (backup)

### Production Origins:
- `https://fading-citizen.github.io`
- `https://your-custom-domain.com` (if applicable)

### Required Headers:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173, https://fading-citizen.github.io
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### Affected Endpoints:
1. `POST /api/agentic-safety` - Chat conversation
2. `GET /api/aspect-summary/{user_id}` - Assessment results

## üõ† Additional Questions

1. **Authentication**: Do we need API keys or authorization headers?
2. **Rate Limiting**: Are there any rate limits we should be aware of?
3. **Error Codes**: What error responses should we handle?
4. **Content Type**: Should we send `application/json` or another format?

## üöÄ Temporary Workaround

I've added a development proxy to bypass CORS locally, but production deployment will still need proper CORS configuration.

## üìß Quick Message Template

```
Hi Backend Team!

Could you please enable CORS on the AI chat API endpoints? 

Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173 (dev) and https://fading-citizen.github.io (prod)
API Endpoints: 
- POST /api/agentic-safety
- GET /api/aspect-summary/{user_id}

Currently getting CORS errors when trying to connect from frontend.

Thanks!
```
